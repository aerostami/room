# room
This project is developed using pure legacy OpenGL.
The lighting technique is a simple creative technique of my own. :D
Textures seen on the walls and on the floor are not textures read from an image, those patterns are created through a random function which generates the related vertices.
When the clock reaches 12:00, a boxing glove will pop out of the clock for 3 times.

controls:
'c' : 5 minutes forward on the clock instantly.
'd' : toggles the debug mode, only lines will be displayed in debug mode and the polygons will not be filled with color.
'a' : the axes will appear in the center of the room which are only visible in the debug mode.
't' : toggles the textures.
'o' : opens the clock door manually.
't' : draws a line rendering teapot on the table.
